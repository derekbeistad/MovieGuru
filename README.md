# a movie streaming clone

Built using Next.js (React.js, Node.js), MongoDB and Mongoose, and OAuth login.

Shows and movies can be browsed without logging in, but to view the movie page, the user must be login in. Titles are stored in MongoDB databases and are then filtered by category into their own carousels.
